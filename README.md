# Contact form
 
We had to create a contact form. It should be able to submit the form data with (ajax/fetch).  If input data in the fields is bad, javascript and/or html show errors. If the message is successfully sent we get a confirmation, if not, there's an error. 

This project was one of our first serious challenges.
